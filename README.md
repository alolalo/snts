# SAY NO TO SUICIDE PUBLIC LICENSE 

We've lost so many genius developers, who committed suicide, 
such as [Aaron Hillel Swartz (November 8, 1986 – January 11, 2013)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz).

As a developer, the community needs you, the world needs you, please keep yourself alive.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, MODIFICATION, AND DISTRIBUTION

  1. You can do anything with the original copy, 
  whenever, whatever, no limitation.
  
  2. When you are in despair, just talk to someone you trust, 
  someone you love. Getting help from your family, your friends, 
  the police, the community, the public.
  
  3. Keep yourself alive and say no to suicide on your body. Eat healthy please, don't drink too
  much coffee, and have your daily intake of water. Your physical body has basic needs
  too, all those added chemicals will not help to recover, and your body will help you get 
  through life even if your mind can't cope with the stress some days. Take care of it, please.
  
  4. Don't think because you need help you are helpless or cannnot help one other.
  The last thing you need is to be put into a perception of weak, because it's your
  strength and grit that will get you back on top of your old self again. 
  
  5. Remind yourself of the fact that everyone has these days, AND that there are people around 
  you every day that are just like you. It's ok, and it's ok to be verbal about it without getting
  any laughter for it in return. It's exactly that which makes people fear talking about it in the 
  first place; being taken seriously for having these kind of thoughts
